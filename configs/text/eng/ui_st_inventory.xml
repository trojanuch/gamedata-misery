		<text>Ionizing radiation poisoning\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Exposure to ionizing radiation poses an extremely high risk to the USS operative. For this reason every member of USS personnel is required to undergo training which enables them to adequately measure radiation levels. This skill becomes a key factor in their effectiveness within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The basic unit in the scale of ionizing radiation is millisievert (%c[0,210,210,210]mSv%c[0,170,170,170]). Level of approximately %c[0,210,210,210]8000 mSv %c[0,170,170,170]is usually lethal without a chance of recovery. Radiation levels above the threshold of 1000 mSv (see below) may gradually negatively impact USS operative's performance. iIn case of exposure it is thus strongly advised to administer anti-radiation drugs of appropriate potency as soon as possible. Table 3.2 presents radiation levels with typical symptoms:\n \n%c[0,102,255,0]250 – 1500 mSv: %c[0,140,140,140]Symptoms are unnoticeable. Long term consequences are negligible.\n \n%c[0,255,255,0]1500 – 3000 mSv: %c[0,140,140,140]Noticeable moderate to strong sickness, light-headedness, skin stains. Long-term symptoms are mild. Full recovery is possible if treated promptly.\n \n%c[0,255,122,0]3000 – 4500 mSv: %c[0,140,140,140]Very strong sickness, confusion and dizziness with premature death if not treated in relatively short time. Complete cease of hunger and thirst, taint, diarrhoea, shedding of skin and hair loss. High risk of permanent loss of reproduction ability. Restoration of bodily functions is feasable with extensive use of cleansing agents.\n \n%c[0,204,0,51]4500 – 6000 mSv: %c[0,140,140,140]Intensification of the above symptoms. Additionally, permanent damage to central nervous system. Death highly probable.\n \n%c[0,204,0,51]6000 mSv and above: %c[0,140,140,140]Imminent death.

Thermal radiation\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Typical fire anomaly in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone comprises two separate elements: %c[0,210,210,210]hemisphere-shaped thermal radiation field -%c[0,170,170,170] producing constant temperature of up to %c[0,210,210,210]50 kW / m2%c[0,170,170,170] density, inducing temperatures of up to %c[0,210,210,210]430 °C%c[0,170,170,170] and %c[0,210,210,210]'burner anomalies' -%c[0,170,170,170] destructive emissions of flames of up to %c[0,210,210,210]1000 °C%c[0,170,170,170] launching upwards from a single point usually located apporox. 10 cm above the ground. Mechanism governing these emissions hasn't been properly examined ,but we know for a fact that outbursts occur whenever any solid object enters an approximately%c[0,210,210,210]0,5 meters-wide%c[0,170,170,170] 'activation field' (of suspectedly gravitational nature).\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]For the purposes of assessment of potency of Exclusion Zone's fire anomalies and in order to indicate available counter-measures a %c[0,210,210,210]kW/m2%c[0,170,170,170] (for kilowatts per square meter) (kilowatts per square meter equivalents) scale is used. This unit indicates a density of heat flux generated by the anomaly and thus the volume of energy.\n \n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] inside of an average campfire: %c[0,210,210,210]500 °C or 29 kW/m2\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] average thermal rad. field flux: %c[0,210,210,210]620 °C or 51,5 kW/m2\n \n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] average burner outburst: %c[0,210,210,210]1000 °C or 212 kW/m2\n \n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] approx. unprotected surival time: %c[0,210,210,210]RF: 1,5 min / BU: 0,5 sec\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] approx. complete armor degr. time: %c[0,210,210,210]RF: 10 min / BU: 6 sec\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]RF = radiation field ; BU = 'burner anomaly'\n \n%c[0,210,210,210]2. Acid\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]It is common knowledge that potent pools of acid (called 'fruit punch anomalies') can be found within Exclusion Zone's areas of high toxicity ('toxic anomalies'). These gravitationally sustained 'tanks' are extremely unstable and lose their form the moment they come in contact with solid matter. Any such occurrence produces a powerful outburst equivalent to the use of up to %c[0,210,210,210]0,5 liters%c[0,170,170,170] of potent oxidizing agents / sulphuric acid of %c[0,210,210,210]50%%c[0,170,170,170] concentration. These outbursts entail the eruption of acid which spreads in a form of droplets launching upwards in approximately %c[0,210,210,210]2 meter%c[0,170,170,170] radius.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Any substance of this level of corrosivity affects human body and equipment in a way similar to strong thermal radiation and causes the skin and other organic and non-organic substances to melt in a matter of seconds. It is thus highly advised to avoid these anomalies while unprotected by professional scientific equipment. In order to facilitate comparison the potency of acids is usually measured in thermal radiation scale of %c[0,210,210,210]kW / m2%c[0,170,170,170] equivalents.\n \n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] Average 'Fruit punch' anomaly potency: %c[0,210,210,210]120 °C or 1,9 kW/m2 eq.\n \n \n</text>

Exclusion Zone's anomalous toxic areas (which often cover several hundred square meters) have been proven to have the concentration of as much as 200 ppm (whereas '200' denotes the number of drops of such substances diluted in 1,000,000 parts of the solution), which makes them one of the most hazardous environments on the planet, strong enough to kill an average human being not protected with scientific equipment in about %c[0,210,210,210]3 minutes%c[0,170,170,170].\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]For this reason and for assessment purposes potency of anomalous areas and effectiveness of protective gear is graded based on the amount of parts of (%c[0,210,210,210]ppm eq.%c[0,170,170,170]) concentration of %c[0,210,210,210]Class I (C1)%c[0,170,170,170] toxic substance per million parts of the solution (%c[0,210,210,210]ppm%c[0,170,170,170]). This gives an universal 'anomalous' toxicity measuring scale of %c[0,210,210,210]C1 ppm equivalents%c[0,170,170,170]. In the case of equipment this value indicates the C1 ppm toxicity concentration which certain item is able to protect from.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]From scientific data acquired so far we can deduce that in order to ensure a safe accomplishment of tasks that require venturing into one of Exclusion Zone's toxic anomalous areas, it is recommended to use equipment designed specifically for the purposes of anomaly exploration and 'artifact' gathering. However, even with appropriate gear it is still strongly advised to avoid prolonged exposure to anomalous toxic environments due to their proven highly corrosive properties.\n \n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] av. toxic anomaly potency: %c[0,210,210,210]~200 C1 ppm eq.\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] av. unprot. survival time: %c[0,210,210,210]~3 min \n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] av. time for compl. suit degr.: %c[0,210,210,210]~25 min\n \n%c[0,204,0,51]IMPORTANT:\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Exclusion Zone's toxic fields are very often accompanied by large concentrations of acids (commonly known as 'fruit punch anomalies') which are capable of producing outbursts of highly potent oxidizing agents.

		<text>Electricity\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Electrical anomalies of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone are undoubtedly one of its potentially most beneficial creations. Powerful and constant electric arcs stretched in what appears to be a simple composition of gases could if harnessed provide enormous amounts of pure energy. Unfortunately, all attempts to obtain electricity from these anomalies were to no avail since they are extremely unstable and any contact with solid matter results in massive outbursts of energy. Such phenomena are unheard of in modern science as our sensors have registered a sudden rise in both voltage and current that would cause any capacitors currently produced to overheat due to the erratic nature of the anomaly.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Voltage peaks produced during such outbursts amount to %c[0,210,210,210]4,0 megavolts (MV)%c[0,170,170,170], which allows the current to reach as high as %c[0,210,210,210]3,5 meters%c[0,170,170,170] above the ground. Since the outbursts last around %c[0,210,210,210]50 miliseconds%c[0,170,170,170]energy produced inside the anomaly during one outburst is not enough to kill a healthy, grown man. However, extensive health damage and severe trauma should be expected and the second outburst (which is very likely to occur if one does not exit the field without undue delay) is in most cases fatal.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]As is the case with all static electrical discharges the best means of protection is increasing electrical resistance of the body. This can be achieved in several ways, primarily by wearing protective, non-conductive clothing. There are also military and civilian grade surge suppressors available on the market. Moreover, out most recent data suggests that there are certain 'artifacts' rarely found in the Exclusion Zone possessing the qualities of very potent electrical resistors.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]For the purposes of USS operations in the Exclusion Zone effectiveness of all  means of electrical resistance and combat armors is measured in the number of kilovolts (%c[0,210,210,210]kV%c[0,170,170,170]) a given piece of equipment is able to resist during a single%c[0,210,210,210]3000 kV%c[0,170,170,170] / %c[0,210,210,210]50 ms%c[0,170,170,170] outburst of electrical anomaly.\n \n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] av. electrical anomaly power: %c[0,210,210,210]~3 MV\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] single outburst dam. rate to unprot. body: %c[0,210,210,210] 95%\n \n \n</text>

Such fields ordinarily take a hemispherical shape  with the source at their centre. Of note is that they are able to either immediately kill or induce an unrecoverable coma within seconds of exposure (this applies to any human being not protected with additional equipment). The potency of psy field varies depending on the distance from the source: the weakest being at the edges of the field and increasing at geometric rate the closer to the source.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]It has been established that beside the main 'psy radiation', each field also produces a faint, low frequency  (%c[0,210,210,210]50-60 Hz%c[0,170,170,170]) magnetic field which althou harmless, can be easly detected and measured allowing for assesment of main psy field's strenght.

		<text>Rupture protection\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Rupture protection level remains a significant factor when operating within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and must not be underestimated. This is due to often extremely aggressive and carnivorous fauna which has mutated excessively owing to the special characteristics of the Exclusion Zone and developed lethal means of incapacitating the target.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]The collective term %c[0,210,210,210]'mutants'%c[0,170,170,170] refers to beings of animal and possibly human origin which are the outcome of this abnormal evolution. They can take a variety of shapes and forms depending on their progenitor and the extent of mutation – and have at their disposal several means of inflicting damage and killing  their prey. Common types of attacks include biting, cutting the skin and clothing with sharp claws, stabbing with protruding fangs, charging at the prey as well as kicks and punches.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]The most popular means of protection against this threat is using clothing manufactured in such a way so as to make in virtually impenetrable to animal attacks. Although normally even a thin layer of protective material can keep you out of harm's way, in the Exclusion Zone it is advisable to use only specially designed anti-laceration fibers. For convenience reasons such fibers are integrated into almost every modern type of anti-ballistic personal armor.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Rupture protection values of a certain armor piece are in direct connection to its anti-ballistic protection class. This is especially true of any NIJ  %c[0,210,210,210]Class AIII (and higher)%c[0,170,170,170] and above which have increasingly large number of integrated %c[0,210,210,210]metal plates%c[0,170,170,170]The use of metal plates is by far the most effective method of protecting oneself from rupture damage.\n \n%c[0,204,0,51]IMPORTANT:\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Even though clothing of high  durability and thickness can significantly reduce damage inflicted by firearm projectiles and animal attacks of all kinds, the materials the clothing is made of are not indestructible and will slowly degrade, gradually decreasing its environmental and physical protection values. Rate at which armor degrades is %c[0,210,210,210]is not a constant value%c[0,170,170,170] and depends on the condition of the unit, which means that %c[0,204,0,51]the condition of equipment will deteriorate the faster the more damaged the equipment.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]For this reason it is %c[0,210,210,210]strongly advised%c[0,170,170,170] to undertake maintenance of suits and headgears as frequently as possible and avoid taking severe, structural damage.\n \n \n</text>
