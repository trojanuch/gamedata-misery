		<text>A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artifact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Due to its effectiveness, this artifact is in great demand. It, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a “Bubble” that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artifact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that “Bubble” needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artifact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artifact is the fact that it speeds us healing process and closes up wounds, however this feature is so potent that it justifies its high price on the market and the demand for it. Due to its effectiveness in that area, this artifact can be used even in the middle of a fight to ensure survival.

Secondly, it provides substantial protection against any types or kinds of acids by gradually increasing their pH to the level of water (pH of 7). Thirdly, this artifact soothes the pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that even potentially lethal damage inflicted by any of Zone's mutants can be “knit” and the bleeding stopped by the “Eye.” Many stalkers report that they managed to survive after being attacked by mutants when they ran out of bandages thanks exclusively to this artifact. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price. This artifact is extremely dangerous when exposed to chemical anomalies as it amplifies their toxicity and increases their potency. It is hence highly recommended to keep the artifact in a backpack, never on the body, when exploring toxic areas unless you have a death wish.

It is known to spontaneously combust when exposed to temperature exceeding 60°C. The artifact provides a high amount of toxic and chemical protection by absorbing chemical agents. It then uses them as basis for producing its gooey substance which, when applied to wounds, soothes the pain and speeds up healing process. ”Soul” also amplifies the effects of psy-waves and increases the damage of electricity to one's body. It is also known to drain power from its user. The artifact does not have high density and thus is not very heavy.

All parts that can be taken from chimera's corpse can be sold for a large amount of money, but it is the skin that is one of the most valued scientific items as well as one of the best armor enhancements available in the Exclusion Zone. It offers very good protection properties and, even more importantly, is relatively light-weight thanks to which it does not limit mobility. However, its most unique feature is that organic fibers found in the skin act as very effective electrical conductors. This fact to large degree confirms reports of recon units (especially those scouting around the AMK Industrial Complex) concerning sightings of chimeras surrounded in what looked like an electrical anomaly, producing discharges on contact with any hostile living organism. Unfortunately, no unit was able to make it back, so there is no evidence confirming the existence of such a creature.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n \n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] heavy mutant pelt\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] very rare scientific specimen\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] extremely valuable\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] damage prot. equivalent of 7 kevlar sheets\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] effectiveness of mult. units is stackable\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] usable for:%c[0,170,170,170] heavy armor repairs (+8%)</text>

		<text>Skin of a pseudogiant in many ways resembles the skin of an elephant. It's thick and hard in touch, its texture is very irregular and full of folds which act as the creature's cooling mechanism. Average thickness of pseudogiant's skin is around 2 cm, which makes it very durable and capable of withstanding significant damage. This is, however, at the cost of increased weight. Since pseudogiants are known to often live in areas of high toxicity and radioactivity, the hide naturally adapted to such conditions, which further increases its usefulness. It can also be used to patch even the heaviest of armors but this process requires the most durable and expensive tools available. It is valued not only for its practical qualities, but can also serve as a prestigious hunting trophy and a rare specimen for the scientists in the Zone.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n \n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] very heavy mutant pelt\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] scientific specimen\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] valuable\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] damage prot. equivalent of 13 kevlar sheets\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] effectiveness of mult. units is stackable\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] usable for:%c[0,170,170,170] heavy armor repairs (+9%)</text>

Confidential sources within the military also revealed that fingerprints of the person who turned into a controller can sometimes be found in the database, however this information remains highly classified. Recent analysis shows that not only the hand of the controller is capable of producing psy waves – the whole body is the source of emissions. For this reason, the scalp - when prepared properly - has the ability to absorb and filter psy energy, but for this effect to take place it is necessary to cover your head with multiple scalps. The skin is also electrically conductive. As regards its physical properties, it is light and can only be used for minor outfit repairs.
