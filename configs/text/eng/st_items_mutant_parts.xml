From the remains of their clothing we can deduce that izloms originate from prisoner population that was stationed the Exclusion Zone and sentenced for forced labor. Since the deformation of the body is almost identical in case of all izloms, it is supposed that when the exposure took place all subjects were in the same body position - either because they were in the process of being transported or because someone purposely placed them so. All specimens encountered so far were male and sterile. Hence it can be safely assumed that the izlom population is unable to reproduce, and their number in the Zone is steadily getting lower. For this reason, at present date they remain one of the most rarely encountered type of mutant, and highly deformed, right hand of an izlom constitutes a valuable research object.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] mutated body part\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] rare scientific specimen\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] valuable</text>

		<text>An eye of the pseudogiant has the appearance of a larger human eye, but with a few differences. It has a multi-colored iris and its tear glands are exceptionally well developed.

While presence of living crow herd can often prove invaluable when navigating and evading danger among the empty streets of Chernobyl and Pripyat, it's only after their death when true value is manifested.\n \nThe keratin layer which surrounds beaks of most bird species found on Earth - in case of Chernobyl crows becomes harder, almost rock-like with each year that the animal survives among the radioactive willderness. For specimens older than 2 years it's often already solid enough to constitute an effective sharpening material for common metal tools or blades made of cast iron or military-grade steel alike. \n \nIt is not known why despite massive crow genocide - which initially resulted from discovery of this fact - the population of crows in the Zone has seemingly not only not shrunk but even expanded. It is believed that accelerated adaptation, typical among Zone's fauna - in case of crows has provided them with not only sped-up reproduction cycle resulting in up to 4 egg lays during each nesting season and prolonged life-span of up to 20 years, but also has given them extra-ordinary inteligence manifested especially when many crows are gathered around in close proximity to each other.\n \nThis last feat has led to rather peculiar custom among the some of the Zone-dwellers which - as rumor has it - has been introduced by the very first stalkers who arrived in the Zone after the second incident. The ritual - aptly reffered to as "The Beak" is said to comprise of taking a powder made from pulverisded beak of the eldest crow in the herd and creating a special mixture. When concoction is consumed in the middle of night accompanied by 'arcane' incantations, allows one's mind to temporarly merge with multi-consciousness shared by all crows in the Zone. It is not known what happens to fragile human mind when it is subjected to such an experience, but some speculate that this is what has led Stalker named Noah to build his Arc in a desperate attempt to preserve whatever possible, from the inevitable cataclysm that is about to once again fall upon this already devastated land.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] mutated body part\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] very common scientific specimen\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] usable for repairing equipment\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] not usable below condition level: %c[0,170,170,170]5%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] base condition gain: %c[0,170,170,170]6%\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]SUPPORTED MATERIALS:\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] sharpening stones %c[0,170,170,170]+11%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] steel wool %c[0,170,170,170]+5%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] 'diamond powder' %c[0,170,170,170]+28%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] cleaning solvents %c[0,170,170,170]+3-7%</text>
