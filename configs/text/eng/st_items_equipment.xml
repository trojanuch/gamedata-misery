The metal bottle is divided into two separate compartments, one for oil and the other one for the cleaning solvent. It was used extensively in World War II and could be found in standard-issue Mosin-Nagant's buttstock containers. At that time, the solvent was based on an alcaline solution for effective clean-up of preservation salts in which ammunition was commonly shipped and stored. Since then the composition of liquids has been modernized many times, but the simple yet ingenious 'double' bottle design remained unchanged.  "Dvojka" is very popular in the Exclusion Zone due to its versatility. Bear in mind, however, that the liquids require adequate tools to be spread properly and so that it can reach deep into weapon's inner mechanisms. “Dvojka” should thus be regarded as more of an addon than a stand-alone maintenance item.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] technological item\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] liquid gun oil and cleaning solvent\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] usable for repairing equipment\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] not usable below condition level: %c[0,170,170,170]90%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] base condition gain: %c[0,170,170,170]8%\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]SUPPORTED MATERIALS:\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] additional gun oils %c[0,170,170,170]+3-6%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] additional cleaning solvents %c[0,170,170,170]+3-7%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] light tools %c[0,170,170,170]+2-5%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] paper (sheets) %c[0,170,170,170]+1-2%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] cloth (sheets) %c[0,170,170,170]+2-4%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] textile (sheets) %c[0,170,170,170]+2-4%</text>

		<text>PFM-1 (short for ïðîòèâîïåõîòíàÿ ôóãàñíàÿ ìèíà; NATO name: "Green parrot") used to be a standard-issue anti-personnel mine of the Red Army, employed mainly during the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. Its widespread utilization during the conflict led to high civilian casualties, especially among children, since randomly scattered mines were often mistaken for toys due to their familiar shape and color. For this reason, the PFM-1 earned a sinister nick-name: "Child killer." Since then, the mine has been replaced by newer models. However, as was the case with a variety of other 'retired' weaponry, a large number of these mines has somehow made its way into the Zone, becoming its primary booby-trap explosive. The mine is highly valued mainly for its functionality, user-friendliness, compact size and low weight, while its main drawback is a relatively small amount of explosive material: its power is often insufficient to kill a heavily armored Stalker with a single blast. For this reason, the mine should be used in combination with other explosive materials and it acts as an igniter.

		<text>\n \n%c[0,204,0,51]WARNING: Explodes upon impact\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Heavy metal gas balloon impregnated with compatible polymer on the inside for the CO2/02 gas stored and on the outside with Hypalon for weather abrasion and UV resistance. This gas holder balloon is a collapsible, intermediated storage tank for any industrial gas, prior to bottling under pressure. Upon direct gunfire, the cannister may ignite and after a short while a rapid release of a considerable amount of energy may follow causing the surrounding air to expand instantly and resulting in a delayed but powerful explosion with metal shrapnels going in every direction. Unfortunately, such cannisters have been utilized as a weapon in the feuds between factions in the Zone killing many and crippling even more. If emptied, the balloon can be utilized for heavy armor repairs.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] explosive\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] technological item\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] usable for:%c[0,170,170,170] heavy armor repairs (+5%)\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] triggering mechanism: %c[0,170,170,170]bullet impact or explosion\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] blast power: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] blast radius: %c[0,170,170,170]6,4 m\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] fragments' radius: %c[0,170,170,170]36 m\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] av. number of fragments: %c[0,170,170,170]28 (heavy metal elements)\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] explosion delay: %c[0,170,170,170]~2 seconds</text>

		<text>\n \n%c[0,204,0,51]WARNING: Explodes upon impact\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]A large (with capacity of about 20 litres), half-emptied metal can with explosive fuel. Jerrycans were brought to the Zone in large quantities by the Ukrainian military for their armored vehicles. Initially, they served their purpose, but after the second Chernobyl Disaster vehicles for reasons still unknown were no longer operational. While some Zoners are still trying to make the wrecks work again, others have found alternate ways of utlizing the jerrycans; namely, as improvised explosives. Upon direct hit, the cannister will catch fire and explode after a slight delay. Although heavy and cumbersome, a full and well placed jerrycan can be lethal even if the target wears the heaviest of body armors. On the other hand, the explosion is often so potent that the killer becomes the victim himself, so it's best to use these cannisters with caution. There are rumors that a veteran Stalker named Yuya once saved his skin by luring a pseudogiant into a jerrycan trap. He emptied his last Makarov magazine and the giant burst into flames with a roar that was heard throughout the Jupiter.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] explosive\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] technological item\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] usable for:%c[0,170,170,170] heavy armor repairs (+4%)\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] triggering mechanism: %c[0,170,170,170]bullet impact or explosion\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] blast power: %c[0,170,170,170]medium\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] blast radius: %c[0,170,170,170]5,6 m\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] fragments' radius: %c[0,170,170,170]28 m\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] av. number of fragments: %c[0,170,170,170]39 (heavy metal pieces)\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] explosion delay: %c[0,170,170,170]~3 seconds</text>
