Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a disease caused by the bacteria Clostridium tetani which enters the body through open wounds and releases a poison called tetanospasmin. This is a potentially deadly disease because the poison attacks the nervous system blocking nerve signals from the spinal cord to and from the muscles. Animals of the Zone have a high likehood of carrying the Teranus disease and it spreads easily through bites. As injection of inactivated toxin overally boosts users organism activity, there are several positive side-effects of usage can be experienced.
